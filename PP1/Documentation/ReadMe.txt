Instructions:
My zip file that I submitted contains 7 total files. 3 pdfs (including this one), 3 source files, and 1 Make file. The Jordan_Coe_P1_Q1.pdf goes over the results I got for the first question of the project. Jordan_Coe_Gaussian_Elimination_Documentation.pdf is the documentation for my gaussian elimination code. To compile and run the source files, call “make all” from the make file. This will compile all the source files and create executables. All 3 of my executables have 1 parameter that will dictate how many threads will be used. If no parameter is specified then it will default to 16 threads (8 threads for Gaussian Elimination).
